# hellobooks_client

This project aims at creating a ReactJS client to consume the hellobooks_api([herokuapp](https://fast-stream-12738.herokuapp.com) & [Github](https://github.com/oagutu/hellobooks_api))

A user should thus be able to access the hellobooks API endpoints via the UI provided by our client
